1. Mappings (templates)
-----------------------

tasks: template for the main index with tasks metadata.
       Contains mappings for documents of two types:
       - task (parent)
       - output_dataset (child)

progress: template for index with events processing historical data.
          Contains mapping for documents of type:
          - task_progress

tasks-nested: 'tasks' template with parent/child relationship replaced
              with nested field.
              Contains mapping for documents of type:
              - task


2. Field descriptions
---------------------

toths06: CPU resources used by the task. Origins from ChicagoES:
         jobs_archive_YYYY-MM-DD -> jobs_data -> doc['hs06sec'], total
         value for the task jobs with status 'finished' or 'failed'.

toths06_finished: CPU resources the task would use in the perfect world
                  (see description for `toths06`).

toths06_failed: 'wasted' CPU resources (see description for `toths06`).

input_events: derived value based on primary_input_events, requested_events,
              n_files_per_job, n_events_per_job, n_files_to_be_used.

_update_required: service field to mark documents that contain incomplete
                  information about object and thus must be updated sooner
                  or later.
