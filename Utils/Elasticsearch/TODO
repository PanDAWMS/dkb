Benchmarking utility (tools/benchmark-db-queries.py)
====================================================


General things
--------------

Be minimal: try to allow the utility to produce something useful
(e.g., dump queries if only this mode was requested) when the full
library stack (Oracle libraries, cURL, etc) is missing.  Also,
import only functionally-needed parts: if we test ElasticSearch,
Oracle support isn't required at all and, thus, must not be imported.


Exception handling
------------------

... everywhere.


Control knobs
-------------

Enable/disable persistent HTTP connections to ES.


Timing/measurement infrastructure
---------------------------------

Option to include Oracle session establishment time to the
query timings.

Add inner loop for fast queries to measure the mean value for many
iterations (weak time source, anyone?).

Add different timesources and make them configurable.  Provide
an option and framework to measure their quality.
