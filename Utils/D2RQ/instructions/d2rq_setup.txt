1) Requirements:
D2RQ needs Java 1.5 or later to run;

2) Installing D2RQ:
1. Download and extract the archive into a suitable location.
2. Download the Oracle JDBC driver. The correct driver is ojdbc7.jar, it can be obtained from Oracle website after accepting licence agreement. Place the driver to /lib/db-drivers.

3) Configuring the server:
1. Generate a mapping file for your database schema using the generate-mapping tool. (Does not work for majority of CERN databases, generated mappinga are lacking about 90% tables)
2. Edit mapping to reflect DB structure and desired ontology. This is extremely time consuming, 90% setup time is spent on the mapping editing. The syntax is described here: http://d2rq.org/d2rq-language

4) Running the server:
Start the server: d2r-server mapping.ttl
The server is now ready to accept queries.
