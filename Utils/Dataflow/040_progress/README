=============
* Stage 040 *
=============

1. Description
--------------
Generate documents with information about task current progress.

Original messages are passed as they are.

Stage's output goes to stage 019, so it must contain meta-fields for ES bulk
load.

2. ToDo
-------
Currently it is merely a placeholder that does nothing but passes the input
messages to the output -- so "ToDo" is "To implement the requred messages
processing logic."
