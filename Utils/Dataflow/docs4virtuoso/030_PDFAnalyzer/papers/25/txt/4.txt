– Event within list of good runs as defined by data quality ﬂags listed in Table 4 of [5]
– Muon-triggered event with trigger listed in Table 5 of [5]
– At least one good primary vertex with |z(PV )| < 200mm and three tracks

• Requirements on two muons in the event:

– Muid combined (author = 12)
– pT > 25 GeV
– |h | < 2.4
– |z0| < 1 mm, |d0| < 0.2 mm with respect to the primary vertex
– expectBLayerHit=false or numberOfBLayerHits ≥ 1
– number of pixel hits + number of crossed dead pixel sensors ≥ 2
– number of SCT hits + number of crossed dead SCT sensors ≥ 6
– number of pixel holes + number of SCT holes ≤ 1
– for |h | < 1.9, require nT RT > 5 and noutliers
and if nT RT > 5, then require noutliers
where the counts on the r.h.s. are mutually exclusive.

T RT

T RT < 0.9nT RT . For |h | ≥ 1.9, accept if nT RT ≤ 5,
< 0.9nT RT . For these cuts, nT RT = nhits
T RT + noutliers

T RT

– MS f hits > 0
– Inner, middle and outer MDT/CSC precision layers with at least 3 hits in each. The MS

precision 3-layer requirement should be fulfilled completely in the barrel or in the endcap.

– Tracks with hits in BEE, EE and BIS78 MS chambers are vetoed
– Isolated muons in the ID: S pT (cone 0.3)/pT < 0.05

• Finally, the dimuon pair must have:
– Both muons opposite charge
– mmm ≥ 70 GeV

For search and limit setting purposes, we define our signal region to be above a reconstructed mass
of mmm ≥150 GeV, and our control region 70 ≤ mmm < 110 GeV. The acceptance times efficiency of this
selection ranges from 35-40% for our contact interaction samples in the signal region, growing inversely
