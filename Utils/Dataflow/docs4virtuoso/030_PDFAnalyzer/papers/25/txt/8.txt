4.1.1 Choice of Prior
The prior in Eq. 4 can be factored as P(q ,n ) = P(q )P(n ). Ideally we would like to choose P(q ) to be
ﬂat in the observable parameter q . Since the interference term in Eq. (2) dominates as L → ¥
, we choose

a prior of the form

q =

1
L 2 .

(7)

Typically, this is the prior chosen for contact interaction searches.

P(n ) is taken as a Gaussian with width dNexp, representing the effect of systematic uncertainties to
is integrated out by sampling from P(n ) in

be discussed later in the text. The posterior dependence on n
each mass bin 50,000 times (enough to cover the Gaussian-distributed systematics’ phase space).

4.1.2 Limit Setting Method and Results

k

We can write Eq. (3) using nk = number of events observed in data in a given invariant mass bin k
and m k = Nexp
(q ,n k), the number of expected events in each mass bin in the presence of new physics.
We have chosen 9 mass bins with limits of Mmm = 150, 170, 200, 240, 300, 400, 550, 800, 1200 and
2000 GeV (Fig. 6) and calculated the expected number of events after normalizing the distribution in the
control region. To provide more values of Nexp to be used in the construction of the posterior PDF, we fit
the number of expected events in each bin according to
Nexp(L ) = c0 +

The fits for both constructive and destructive interference are shown in Fig. 7.

For for the expected limit, we take the number of SM-only background events bk as the number
of observed events from MC in each mass bin. The posterior PDF with marginalized systematics is
drawn as a function of q which takes the prior discussed in section 4.1.1 into account. Without sys-
tematics, the integral of the normalized posterior PDF in Eq. (6) with q = 1
L 2 yields an expected limit
of L −lim = 5.2 TeV for constructive interference and L +
lim = 4.9 TeV for destructive interference (both
at 95% C.L.). Fig 8 shows the expected posterior PDF distributions from MC for SM-only and in the
presence of a L − = 5 TeV constructive interference signal. In the latter case, there would be a clear
preference at 1

L 2 = 0.04 [TeV−2].

In order to determine the range of the expected limit within statistical ﬂuctuations, 5000 pseudo-
experiments were performed, varying Ni events in each bin by a random Poisson amount. The resulting
