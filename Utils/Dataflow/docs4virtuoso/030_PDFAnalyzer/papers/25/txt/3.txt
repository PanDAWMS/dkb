2 Datasets and Monte Carlo Production
Our dataset consists of the full 2010 run. This corresponds to ∼42 pb−1 of muon-triggered data, collected
with stable beam conditions and fully operational inner detector and muon spectrometer systems.
To model the expected contributions from SM processes, we use leading-order (LO) PYTHIA [4]
Monte Carlo event generation and Geant simulation in the ATHENA MC10 framework. We apply data-
driven momentum corrections to each individual muon and event-level weighting for multiple vertices
according to the same prescription as the Z′ analysis, extensively described in [5]. For the main irre-
ducible background, Z0/g → mm
(DY), we also account for higher order processes by applying QCD
and EW corrections as a function of the true invariant mass. Since the Z0 peak dominates our statis-
tics, we produce the DY samples in invariant mass bins in order to increase the number of events in
the high-mass region. Also included are Z → tt
and the most dominant non-DY background processes
(t¯t,WW,W Z and ZZ) as described in [5], which include muon momentum corrections and vertex pileup
event weights applied. Together, these samples as well as the DY make the total background (b).

For our signal (s) samples, four benchmark values for L

in both the constructive and destructive
LLIM have been chosen (Table 1). Like the DY samples, these are also produced in PYTHIA (LO), and
contain the DY component as well as the interference and pure CI terms. We require the dimuon invariant
mass mmm ≥ 120 GeV in the event generation stage to increase statistics above the Z0 peak where the
new physics would appear. In Table 2, we show the production cross section times the branching fraction
BF(X → mm
) for each of the benchmark samples. We also apply all MC corrections to these samples
in the same way as they have been applied to the DY MC, with the exception of EW corrections. In
this case, since the internal process of the contact term is unknown but the signal sample includes DY as
well, an overall shift in the number of expected events is applied corresponding to the difference in DY
expected events with and without EW corrections. This is important because we extrapolate the expected
, as we will show later in section 4.1.2. Fig. 3 shows the resulting dimuon
invariant mass distribution after event generation, simulation, reconstruction and MC corrections in the
two interference models.
