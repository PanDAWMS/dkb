Figure 5: Negative log-likelihood distribution resulting from pseudo-experiments with ﬂuctuations on

Here, q
is a parameter characterizing the new physics on which we would like to set the limit, and ¯n
encompasses the “nuisance” parameters (for example resolution, efficiency, etc) which are not directly
measured. The Poisson distribution in the product can be approximated with a Gaussian function for
sufficiently large number of observed events in mass bin k (nk ≥ 40).
given ¯n and ¯n can be written as:

According to Bayes’ Theorem, the posterior probability density function (PDF) of the parameter q

where Z normalizes the posterior PDF as a function of q . P(q ,n ) is the prior probability function
depending on q , which should be a function of our new contact interaction scale L
and the nuisance
parameters n . The latter may be marginalized by convolving each Poisson probability with a prior
probability function (typically chosen as Gaussian). For one particular mass bin, the likelihood would
then look like:

4.1 Contact Interaction Limit Setting

(6)

Often when setting a limit one can treat the signal and background contributions separately, such as in
the case of a resonance search [6]. However, because new physics via the contact interaction would have
appeared as a continuous excess of events above the expected DY invariant mass distribution, and the
signal interference with DY component of the background contributes a non-negligible amount to this

excess, we choose to employ a slightly different method than that of the Z′ → mm

search.
