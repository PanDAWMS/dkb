Table 1: Monte Carlo samples used for background estimates in this analysis. The cross section for t¯t is
from the top paper [19], and for the single-top Wt is from the single-top note [27]. The cross sections for
the other processes are obtained from Ref. [28].

following parameters: MD = 800 GeV, MTH = 4000 GeV, 6 extra dimensions. The cross section for this
point is 2 pb.

All simulation samples are generated with the pileup conditions corresponding to MC10b [26].

4 Event Selection

The basic event selection is two muons of the same charge. We describe the details of this selection
below.

• Data events are required to pass the EF mu20 trigger. No trigger requirement is imposed on MC

events.

• We require a primary vertex with the number of tracks associated to the vertex > 5. The tracks in

this case are required to have pT > 150 MeV.

• Combined muons are selected from the StacoMuonCollection [29]. The muons are required to
have |η| < 2.4 and pass the tight muon criteria as defined by the muon performance group. In addi-
tion the muon track should have a B-layer hit if the track traverses an active B-layer module, at least
one hit in the pixel detector, at least 6 hits in the SCT, and pass TRT requirements recommended
by the MCP group. The muons are required to come from the primary vertex by calculating the
muon track z0 with respect to the primary vertex and requiring that |z0 sin(θ)| < 1.5 mm. This is
done to ensure that even in high pile-up events, the muons and the selected tracks in the signal
region (as describe below) will come from the primary interaction.

• The muons are ordered in pT. The leading muon is required to have pT > 25 GeV, and the second

muon is required to have pT > 15 GeV.

• The leading muon is also required to be isolated by requiring the sum of transverse momenta of
tracks in a cone of ∆Rη−φ < 0.2 around the muon (ptcone20) to be less than 0.2×pT of the muon.
0 | < 3.

• The leading muon is required to have low impact parameter significance by imposing |d0/derr

The impact parameter is calculated with respect to the primary vertex in the event.

• No isolation or impact parameter requirements are made on the second muon. Muons can arise
promptly from the black hole, or from the decay of heavy ﬂavor quarks from the black hole. By
not requiring isolation, good signal acceptance to these heavy ﬂavor muons is maintained.
