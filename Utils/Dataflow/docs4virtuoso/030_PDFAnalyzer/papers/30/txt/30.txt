Figure 21: Figure shows the isolation distribution for leading muon for rotating black hole signal in
models with 6 extra dimensions. The distributions are shown for three choices of MTH; 3000, 4000,
and 5000 GeV with MD fixed at 1500GeV. The first bin corresponds to ptcone20/pT < 0.2 which is the
requirement on the leading muon.

Figure 22: Figure shows the NTracks distribution for rotating black hole signal in models with 6 extra
dimensions. The distributions are shown for three choices of MTH; 3000, 4000, and 5000 GeV with MD
fixed at 1500GeV.
