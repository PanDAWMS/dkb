Figure 1: Figure shows a schematic of the different kinematic regions used for b¯b estimation. The phase
space is divided into regions based on d0 significance and isolation of the leading muon. The signal
region is A, with isolated leading muon with low impact parameter significance. Region C has additional
selections to enhance the heavy-ﬂavor fraction.

explained in section 5.2. This background will include contributions from Z+jets, and single-top
in the t and s channels, along with low-pT QCD.

5.1 Estimation of b¯b background
The b¯b background is estimated by using a heavy-ﬂavor rich control region in data and extrapolating to
the signal region using the b¯b MC sample. The estimate is obtained in two steps. In the first step, the
kinematic regions shown in Fig. 1 and described below are used to obtain a b¯b estimate in the background
region with NTracks < 10. In the second step, the b¯b MC is used to extrapolate the prediction from the
background region to the signal region (NTracks ≥ 10). The steps are described below.

5.1.1 Step 1 - In the background region with NTracks < 10

Figure 1 shows the relevant kinematic regions.

Region A is the region of interest; the leading muon has ptcone20/pT < 0.2 and |dsig

0 | < 3. Let us
denote by Adata the number of b¯b events in region A in data, with AMC denoting the number of events
from b¯b MC. Region C has inverted requirements on the isolation and dsig

T < 0.2 to enhance the heavy
ﬂavor fraction (see Appendix C). Let Cdata and CMC denote the number of events in region C in data and
b¯b MC respectively.
We measure the ratio R = AMC/CMC in the b¯b MC. The ratio is 0.328 ± 0.028(stat). Adata is then
given by R·Cdata. Mathematically, this is identical to the method used in Ref. [10]. In data, Cdata = 6480
events. In addition we model the shapes of the muon pT and Emiss
distributions in region Adata using the
shapes in Cdata. By using the shapes from Cdata we are able to ameliorate several issues. Cdata has higher
statistics than Adata and thus lower statistical uncertainties, unlike the MC. Cdata is also naturally better
to model pile-up effects of the data.

For the method to work, the distributions of d0 significance and isolation are required to be well
modeled in the simulation. In Fig. 2 we show the d0 significance for the leading muon in region C. In
