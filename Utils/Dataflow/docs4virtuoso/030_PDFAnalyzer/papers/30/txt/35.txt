Figure 26: Figure shows the fake rate as measured in the S W+jets and single top mixture as a
function of track pT on the left, and as a function of NTracks on the right. No dependence is seen on
either variable.

E Studies of shape of track multiplicity

In Fig. 27, we show the track multiplicity distribution for the different background estimates, and the
observed data points. Figure 27 shows the shape of the track multiplicity distributions for the µ+fake, t¯t
and b¯b backgrounds. The shape of the µ+fake track multiplicity background is compared to the expected
shapes from the W+jet MC samples used in the previous section (Appendix D) in Fig. 28. We can see
that the shape of the µ+fake data-driven background agrees well with the expected shapes from MC.

In Fig. 29, we compare the shape of the t¯t track multiplicity distribution using the nominal sample
with a t¯t sample generated with P and hadronized with P. The nominal sample is generated
with @ and uses H+J for hadronization. The two shapes agree well. The KS probability
for the agreement of shapes is 0.99.

In Fig 30, we show the track multiplicity distribution for data and b¯b MC in the the heavy-ﬂavor
rich control region defined in Sec. 5.1. The data is normalized to the b¯b MC. The KS probability for the
agreement of shapes is 0.96. We repeat the exercise described in Sec. 5.1.2 in this control region. We fit
the b¯b MC with an exponential in the range 4 <NTracks< 14. The fit is e6.77−0.48×NTrack. The fit predicts
2.2 events for NTracks≥ 14, and we observe 1.6 events in the data. The extrapolation procedure is thus
verified in the heavy-ﬂavor control region as well.
