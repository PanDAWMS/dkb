one eligible track, the total event weight is given by w = 1 −(cid:81)n

i=1(1 − fi). The uncertainties on fi for
all tracks in a given event are completely correlated and we account for this correlation when calculating
the uncertainty on w. The sum of uncertainties for all such events gives the uncertainty on the data based
estimate of background from the measurement statistics.

Some other effects that we considered are described here.
• The nominal fake rate is measured after subtracting b¯b and t¯t contributions as shown in Fig. 7. The
total subtraction (t¯t + b¯b) is varied up and down by 1σ to get a low and high fake rate respectively.
The t¯t background is varied by the total systematic uncertainty on this background (see Table 5).
The b¯b background is varied by the uncertainty on R (see sec 5.1.1). The difference in background
predictions from the low and high fake rate is −20% and +18%. We take a systematic uncertainty
of 20% on the µ+fake background due to this subtraction.

• The selection of W events is a possible source of systematic uncertainty. To estimate this, we
perform the same measurement in a Z window. We select dimuon events of opposite sign which
satisfy an invariant mass requirement (76 < Mµµ < 106 GeV). Both muons are required to be
isolated.
In these dimuon events, we look for an extra track to form the denominator. Then
we look for a third muon in the event passing all muon requirements for the second muon of
our analysis. This forms the numerator. We compare the muon rate from the W-window and
Z-window integrated over all track pT. The rate from W after b¯b, t¯t and diboson subtraction is
0.0033 ± 0.0002(stat) ± 0.0007(syst). The corresponding rate from Z is 0.0043 ± 0.0004(stat).
These rates are in reasonable agreement and we do not assign a systematic uncertainty for W-
window selection.

The total systematic uncertainty on the data based estimate is thus a sum in quadrature of the uncer-

tainty from measurement statistics and the 20% due to subtraction of other processes.

6.2 Estimation of t¯t background
The t¯t background is estimated using MC samples. The uncertainty on the theoretical cross section of t¯t
is 9.6% [31, 32]. Predictions in Ref. [32] are calculated with Hathor [33] with mtop = 172.5 GeV, and
CTEQ66. The uncertainty is calculated by adding the scale and PDF uncertainties linearly. The scale
uncertainty is 5.6%, while the PDF uncertainty is 4%. We consider the following systematic variations :
• To check the effect of generator we check the t¯t background from samples generated with 

and hadronized with either  or . This yields a 5.1% uncertainty in the signal region.

• We also vary the mass of the top quark down to 170 GeV and up to 175 GeV. This yields a 4.5%

systematic in the signal region.
