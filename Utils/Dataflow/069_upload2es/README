============
* Stage 69 *
============

Description
-----------
load_data.sh uploads prepared data to ElasticSearch.

Input
-----
...comes from Stage 19 (oracle2esFormat).
JSON documents, one per line:
{{{
<index info>
<data>
<index info>
<data>
...
}}}

Consistency
-----------
consistency.py checks that the data is present in ElasticSearch instead of
uploading it. Input comes from Stage 009(in consistency mode) and only needs 2
fields for now:
{{{
{taskid, task_timestamp}
...
}}}

Consistency check can be run as following:

  ./consistency.py --conf elasticsearch_config

For more information about running the check and its arguments, use:

  ./consistency.py -h

TODO
----
Make the stage aware of EOProcess/EOMessage markers
