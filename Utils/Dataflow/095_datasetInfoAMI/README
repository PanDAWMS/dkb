=============
* Stage 095 *
=============

1. Description
--------------
Obtain physics parameters' values from AMI and append it to the supplied
metadata of output datasets.

AMI maintains valid physics parameters only for datasets with the following
data types/formats:
   - AOD
   - EVNT
   - HITS

Since requesting information from AMI is a very time-consuming process,
the supplied datasets are filtered by data format - the ones with formats
mentioned above are included into request to AMI and their metadata are
updated, while all the others are left unchanged.

2. Requirements
---------------
Proper memberships and grid certificate are required to run the stage.
This includes:

1) Registering in CERN systems (discuss this with your supervisor).
2) Obtaining a grid certificate (https://ca.cern.ch/ca/).
3) Registering in ATLAS Virtual Organization (VO ATLAS, see first link below).
4) Registering on AMI site with the grid certificate(https://ami.in2p3.fr/).
