=============
* Stage 095 *
=============

1. Description
--------------
Obtain physics parameters' values from AMI and append it to the supplied
metadata of output datasets.

AMI maintains valid physics parameters only for datasets with the following
data types/formats:
   - AOD
   - EVNT
   - HITS

Since requesting information from AMI is a very time-consuming process,
the supplied datasets are filtered by data format - the ones with formats
mentioned above are included into request to AMI and their metadata are
updated, while all the others are left unchanged. Request will also include
datasets with undefined data format (missing 'data_format' field).

2. Requirements
---------------
Proper memberships and grid certificate are required to run the stage.
This includes:

1) Registering in CERN systems (discuss this with your supervisor).
2) Obtaining a grid certificate (https://ca.cern.ch/ca/).
3) Registering in ATLAS Virtual Organization (VO ATLAS, see first link below).
4) Registering on AMI site with the grid certificate(https://ami.in2p3.fr/).

for more information.

3. Running the stage
--------------------
Stage can be run as following:

   ./amiDatasets.py --userkey /path/to/key --usercert /path/to/certificate filename.ndjson

which will process the file and produce the result filename.json in the
directory of the file. For more information about running the stage and its
arguments, use:

  ./amiDatasets.py -h

4. Samples
----------
The 'output' directory contains 2 samples:

datasets2016.ndjson - 2016 data (from 093's 2016 sample)
datasets2018.ndjson - 2018 data (from 093's 2018 sample)
