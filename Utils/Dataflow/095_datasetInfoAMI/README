1. Description
--------------
Obtain physics parameters' values from AMI and append it to the supplied
metadata of output datasets.

AMI maintains valid physics parameters only for datasets with the following
data types/formats:
   - AOD
   - EVNT
   - HITS

Since requesting information from AMI is a very time-consuming process,
the supplied datasets are filtered by data format - the ones with formats
mentioned above are included into request to AMI and their metadata are
updated, while all the others are left unchanged.
