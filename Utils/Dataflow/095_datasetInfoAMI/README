=============
* Stage 095 *
=============

1. Description
--------------
This stage is implemented to extract physics parameter values from AMI.


2. Dataflow
-----------

093_datasetsFormat/output --> 095_datasetsFromAMI

As we know, AMI maintains valid physics parameters only for datasets with the
following data types/formats:
   - AOD
   - EVNT
   - HITS

So, during the datasets processing we filter datasetnames by data formats, and
execute requests for AMI only for the filtered datasets. The rest of the
records, which haven't pass the filter, we write to the output "AS-IS".
It allows us to optimize time of data extraction from AMI, which is very
time-consuming.

3. Samples
----------
The 'output' directory contains 2 samples:

datasets.ndjson - 2016 data (from 093's 2016 sample)
datasets2018.ndjson - 2018 data (from 093's 2018 sample)
