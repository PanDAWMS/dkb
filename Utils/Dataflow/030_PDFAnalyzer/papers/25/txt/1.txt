Search for Contact Interactions in Dimuon Events from proton-proton

Collisions at √s = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector

The ATLAS Collaboration

Abstract

We discuss the possibility to discover new physics in the ATLAS Detector via a four-
fermion contact interaction between two initial-state quarks and two final-state muons. In
the absence of new physics signal, we set a 95% C.L. lower limit on the effective scale
L > 4.9 TeV (4.5 TeV) for the constructive (destructive) Left-left Isoscalar Model of quark
compositeness with integrated luminosity of 42 pb−1 at √s = 7 TeV.
