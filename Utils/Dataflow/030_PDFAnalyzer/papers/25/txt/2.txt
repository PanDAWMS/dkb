1 Theoretical Background

Beyond the Standard Model phenomena such as quark/lepton compositeness [1] may be described as
a 4-fermion contact interaction (CI) between two incoming quarks and two final state leptons. In the
same spirit as the Fermi Interaction described b -decay long before the discovery of the W boson, one
can write an effective Lagrangian describing a new interaction without directly knowing the intermediate
process [2]:

L =

2L 2 [ h LL(cid:0) ¯y Lg m y L(cid:1) ( ¯y Lg m y L)] + h RR(cid:0) ¯y Rg m y R(cid:1) ( ¯y Rg m y R) + 2h LR(cid:0) ¯y Lg m y L(cid:1) ( ¯y Rg m y R) ] ,

where g is a coupling constant and y L (y R) is the left (right) fermionic field. The interaction appears
experimentally as a deviation from the Standard Model (SM) dilepton mass spectrum originating from
Drell-Yan (DY) production (q ¯q → g ,Z → l+l−). The value of h
(±1) determines the whether or not
the new physics interference is constructive (h =-1) or destructive (h =+1) with the DY in the observ-
able regime. Often for search purposes, the terms in this Lagrangian are treated as different models.
For example, the Left-Left Isoscalar Model (LLIM) used in this study is defined by h LL = ±1 and
h RR = h LR = 0.

constituents are bound to form the SM quarks and leptons.

Previous searches for contact interactions have been carried out in neutrino scattering, as well as at
electron-positron, electron-proton and hadron colliders [1]. For the quark-quark-dimuon channel pre-
sented here, the best limit in the LLIM is L − > 4.2 TeV (95% C.L.) for constructive interference and
L + > 2.9 TeV (95% C.L.) for destructive interference [3].
