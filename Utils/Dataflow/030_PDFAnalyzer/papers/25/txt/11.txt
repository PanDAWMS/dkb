muon momentum resolution uncertainty, each of these were taken as linear functions of mmm
starting at
the Z0 peak and rising to ± the value obtained at mmm = 1 TeV. The effect of the momentum resolu-
tion uncertainty was assessed by taking the full magnitude of the muon momentum correction to the MC
mentioned in Section 2 as the systematic uncertainty. This was found by fitting the ratio of invariant mass
distributions with and without muon momentum corrections with a second order polynomial (Fig. 11).
The values of this function at the Z0 peak and at mmm = 1 TeV are also shown in Table 5.

Figure 11: DY distributions before and after muon resolution smearing corrections. Though a small
effect, the ratio between smeared/nominal shows a ∼ 10% difference at 2 TeV.

During the creation of the invariant mass distributions, each systematic uncertainty was applied indi-
vidually as an event weight either as a function of true mass (in the case of K-factor and PDF uncertain-
ties) or reconstructed mass (in the case of muon efficiency and momentum resolution uncertainties).

L = (Nk

systematic − Nk

With each systematic individually ﬂuctuated up and down, we create a family of invariant mass
distributions for each MC sample. Note that not all systematics are applied to every sample (as listed
in Table 5). The difference between the expected number of events for each systematic uncertainty
in k mass bins dNi,k
nominal)iL was calculated on the ith systematic for both the full
SM-only background and the benchmark signal samples separately using both upwards and downwards
ﬂuctuations. Taking the larger of either the up or down ﬂuctuation for dNi, the systematics in each mass
bin were added in quadrature: dNkL = (dN1 ⊕ dN2 ⊕ ...⊕ dNi)kL
. Here, we also consider an additional
systematic in the extrapolation fit of Nexp by adding the MC statistical uncertainty of signal samples in
(these values are quoted in Table 4). Finally dNk was fit in each
each mass bin in quadrature to dNkL
mass bin as a function of 1/L 2 to extrapolate between the benchmark signal values (Fig. 12). The value
of dNk at a particular 1/L 2 becomes the width of the Gaussian prior in Eq. 5 in each mass bin (and dNk
b,
the value for SM-only, is used for the p-value and expected limit range calculations). Table 6 shows the
limit with and without adding systematic uncertainties. The effect is smaller than the statistical range of
the limit shown in Fig. 9, with an observed limit difference of 0.17 TeV for constructive interference and
0.14 TeV for destructive interference.
