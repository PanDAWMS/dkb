Figure 12: 2nd-order polynomial fits to dN in each mass bin for the constructive (left) and destructive
(right) interference models as a function of 1
values shown as points. Note that
the total systematic uncertainty for background only ( 1
L 2 = 0) was not used in this fit because the DY
systematics were treated differently than for the signal samples.

5 Conclusions
With the full 2010 data set, we are able to set limits on the 4-fermion contact interaction q ¯q → m +m − in

the LLIM model, for both constructive and destructive interference:

L − > 4.9 TeV (95% C.L.)
L + > 4.5 TeV (95% C.L.)

(10)

These are the best limits to date.

Table 6: Expected and observed lower limits on L with and without systematic uncertainties. The 2nd
decimal place is shown to illustrate the change with the addition of systematics.
