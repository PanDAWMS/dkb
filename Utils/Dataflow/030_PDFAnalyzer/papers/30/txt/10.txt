(a) Region A, C : pT distribution.

(b) Region A, C: Emiss

T

distribution.

Figure 4: Figure shows the pT distribution for the leading muon (4(a)) and Emiss
distribution(4(b)) for
events in regions Cdata and AMC. The data distribution has been normalized to the simulation. The KS
probability of the agreement of shapes is 0.59 for the pT distribution and 0.21 for the Emiss
distribution.
See section 5.1.1 for details.
