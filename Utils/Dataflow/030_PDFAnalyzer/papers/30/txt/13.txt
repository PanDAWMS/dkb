Figure 7: Figure shows the pT distribution of the numerator in data before any subtractions. The contri-
butions to this numerator from b¯b, t¯t , Wt and diboson (WZ + ZZ) production are also shown as stacked
histograms. These will be subtracted from the data before the fake rate is measured.

Table 2: The measured fake rate and uncertainties in the different pT bins.

pT > 60 GeV, the error on the fake rate is taken from the 60 < pT[ GeV] < 120 bin shown in Fig. 8. The
measured fake rate and uncertainties are shown in Table 2. The constant fake rate for pT > 20 GeV is
motivated by MC studies (see Appendix D).
The fake rate increases slightly with increasing |η|. The effect of averaging over the central η hole
(|η| < 0.1) is studied by measuring the pT dependent fake rate separately for |η| < 0.1 and |η| > 0.1.
However, this shows no change in the final predictions. The final fake rate is averaged over all η for
simplicity.

To estimate the background, we select a sample of muon+track events in data, where the muon
passes the requirements of the leading muon for the analysis and the track passes the same requirements
as above. If more than one track passes the cuts, each of them is considered. We compute the probability
for an event to contain a fake and apply it as an event weight. For an event with n tracks, this probability

i=1(1 − pi)), where pi is the probability for the ith track to fake a muon.

is (1 −(cid:81)n

By design, the contribution of double-fakes is included since the selection of muon+track events will

include events where the leading muon is a fake.

A validation of this procedure in simulation samples has been presented in Ref. [10].
