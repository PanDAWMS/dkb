Figure 2: Figure shows the d0/derr
0 distribution for the leading muon in region C, in events where the
leading muon has ptcone20/pT > 0.2. The distributions are normalized to area. The KS probability of
the agreement of shapes is 0.11. The figure on the left is with a linear scale on y-axis, the right is with a
log scale.

Fig. 3 we show the d0 significance and isolation for the second muon in region C. While we make no
requirements on d0 significance and isolation for the second muon, the agreement shown in the figure
gives confidence in the modeling of these variables in the simulation. Region C is expected to be dom-
inated by b¯b + c¯c, with total contributions of t¯t and W+jets estimated from MC to be around 2% of the
total. The comparison of the shapes of the pT and Emiss
distributions between Cdata and AMC is shown
in Fig. 4. These show good agreement; the KS probability for the agreement of shapes ranges from 0.11
for the leading muon d0 significance distribution to 0.59 for the leading muon pT distribution.
5.1.2 Step 2 - Extrapolating to signal region (NTracks ≥ 10)
The region Cdata cannot be used with NTracks ≥ 10 due to potential signal in this region. The signal
region has zero events in the b¯b MC. To estimate the fraction of b¯b events in the signal region, the
NTracks shape in the b¯b MC, i.e. in AMC is extrapolated into the signal region. A simple exponential
function is used for the fit to NTracks and the fit is shown in Fig. 6 (left). The fitted function is Events=
ea−b×NTracks, with a = 6.5 ± 0.2, and b = 0.94 ± 0.08. The function is then integrated from 10 to infinity
to obtain the total number of events with NTracks ≥ 10. The ratio of events in the signal region to
the background region is 0.00036. This ratio, and Adata calculated above yields the b¯b background in
the signal region as 0.77 events. We assign a 100% systematic uncertainty to the b¯b prediction as a
conservative choice.

A cross check of this method is done by relaxing the pT requirements on the two muons in the b¯b
MC till one event is found in the signal region. The relaxed cuts are pT > 12, 11 GeV for the two muons.
The ratio of events in signal region to the background region in this relaxed sample is 0.00031 with a
100% uncertainty.
The nominal fit is done using all events in the b¯b sample, i.e. for 2 < NTracks < 8. We also try various
fit ranges such as [2 − 5] (predict: 0.65), [3 − 8] (predict: 1.1) and [4 − 8] (predict: 1.9). The various
predictions are in decent agreement with the nominal prediction of 0.77 given the 100% uncertainty.

We check the choice of fit, and perform a closure test of the method in the t¯t MC. This is shown in
Fig. 6 (right). The NTracks distribution has a different shape for NTracks < 5 in t¯t versus b¯b as the t¯t
process peaks at 4 tracks (two W’s and two b’s in each event). We fit the NTracks for 6 <NTracks< 11.
We then use the fit to predict the number of events with NTracks ≥ 15 and ≥ 20. The predicted number
