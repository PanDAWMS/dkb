Figure 16: The acceptance from 44 samples corresponding to the error sets of the CTEQ66 PDF set
are shown for a signal point with these parameters: MTH = 4000 GeV and MD = 500 GeV, n = 6,
non-rotating black hole. On left, the acceptance is shown for each error set. On right, the histogram
of acceptances is shown. In both cases, the red points/curve correspond to 5000 generated events per
sample, the black points/curve correspond to 10000 events per sample.

distribution indicates the uncertainty due to signal acceptance. This distribution has been checked for a
different signal point as well. The uncertainty is 3% based on these studies.

Thus the uncertainty on the signal prediction consists of the following components: the uncertainty
on the truth-level acceptance scaling factor, the uncertainty on signal acceptance due to PDF, the uncer-
tainty on the luminosity of the data sample, the experimental uncertainty on acceptance due to muon
trigger and identification measurements and a statistical uncertainty due to the finite MC statistics. These
along with the uncertainties on background estimates described previously give the uncertainties on the
exclusion limits.

Figure 17 shows the exclusion contours for models with non-rotating and rotating black holes with 2
extra dimensions, while Fig. 18 and 19 shows the exclusion for 4 and 6 extra dimensions respectively.
The dashed blue line shows the expected exclusion contour with the 1 σ and 2 σ uncertainty in green
and yellow respectively. The solid black line shows the observed exclusion contour. The region below
the curves is excluded. The figures also show lines of constant slope (MD/MTH) of 3, 4 and 5. The
semi-classical approximations used for black hole production and decay are only valid for slopes much
larger than 1.

9 Conclusion

A search for mini black holes in the final state with two same charge muons was presented in this note.
No excess over the standard model predictions was observed. These results are used to exclude models
in the (MD, MT H) plane.
