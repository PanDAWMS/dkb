1.1.1 Sources of Background

The muons from background processes considered in this analysis can come from three sources. Muons
can arise from processes such as the decay of W (which are prompt muons - µprompt) and the semi-leptonic
decay of b and c hadrons (HF muons - µHF). The decay in ﬂight of pions and kaons also gives rise to
muons, which we designate as non-prompt or fake muons (µfake). It is also possible to reconstruct muons
from a pion or kaon which punches through to the muon spectrometer. For the following discussion and
this analysis we include the punch throughs in µfake along with the decay-in-ﬂight.

The backgrounds considered in this analysis fall in two categories. The two muons in an event can

be produced in association, or they may be arise from decay chains with no connection to each other.

• Associated production of like sign dimuons consists of dimuons from the decay of b¯b 1 and
t¯t events. These dimuon events are predominantly of the µHFµHF category for b¯b and of the
µpromptµHF category for t¯t. We estimate the t¯t background using a simulated sample. We estimate
the b¯b background from simulated samples normalized to data as described in section 5.1.

• Like-sign dimuons from uncorrelated decay chains typically arise from W+jets events, where the
leading muon is µprompt from W decay and the second muon is either a µHF from b, c decay or a
µfake from the jets. Low energy QCD processes can also give like-sign dimuons. The dimuons
in this case consist of the following categories : µpromptµHF, µpromptµfake, µfakeµfake. To estimate
this uncorrelated production we select all events with one muon and an extra track (or tracks).
These events are weighted by the probability for a track (or tracks) to give rise to a muon to get the
dimuon estimate. The measurement of this probability and the method is described in section 5.2.

2 Data Samples and Triggers Used

The data sample used for this analysis was collected with a single muon trigger with pT > 20 GeV
(EF mu20). The data were processed with release 16 of the ATLAS software. The goodrun list pro-
duced by the SUSY Group [14] was used to select periods of data-taking suitable for this analysis. The
integrated luminosity of the data sample is (1.31 ± 0.05) fb−1 [15].

3 Simulation Samples

The Monte-Carlo samples used in this analysis and their corresponding cross-sections are listed in Ta-
ble 1. Some other details of the generated samples are shown in Table 8. The t¯t sample is generated with
@ + J [16, 17, 18] at the nominal top mass of 172.5 GeVand is filtered to have one lepton (e
or µ or τ with pT > 1 GeV) at the generator level. The cross section for the t¯t process is taken from the
top cross section paper [19]. The t¯t sample is generated using the CTEQ66 parton distribution function
(PDF) [20].

The b¯b sample is generated with P. It is filtered at the generator level to have two muons with
pT > 10 GeV each. The diboson samples (WZ and ZZ) are generated with H [21]. They are filtered
to have at least one electron or muon with pT > 10 GeV. The single top background in the Wt channel
is estimated using a sample generated with AMC [22] 2. The b¯b, diboson and single top samples are
all generated using the MRST2007 PDF [23].

The signal samples are generated with B [24, 25] and are hadronized with P. The PDF
used is the CTEQ66 PDF. The nominal black hole signal sample is for a rotating black hole with the
