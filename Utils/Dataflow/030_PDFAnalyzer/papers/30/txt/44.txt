Figure 38: The second muon pT distribution in log scale in the background region (NTracks < 10). The
background histograms are stacked. The bottom part of the figure shows the ratio of data to predic-
tion.The error on the points is statistical, while the red band shows the systematic uncertainty.

Figure 39: The invariant mass distribution of the two muons in log scale in the background region
(NTracks < 10). The background histograms are stacked. The bottom part of the figure shows the ratio
of data to prediction. The error on the points is statistical, while the red band shows the systematic
uncertainty.
