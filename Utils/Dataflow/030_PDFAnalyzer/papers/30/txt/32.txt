Table 10: The number of dimuon events from the different jet-jet samples for the nominal selection. LF
(HF) designates events where the parent of the leading muon is a light (heavy) ﬂavor meson.

C Fraction of heavy ﬂavor in region C
The method to estimate b¯b background as described in Section 5.1 depends on the fraction of heavy
ﬂavor to light ﬂavor dimuon events in region Cdata. Ideally this fraction should be 1. We study the
fraction of heavy ﬂavor events for the region C selection in simulation. The samples used for this study
are the P jet-jet samples (J0 to J8, dataset ID 105009 to 105017 respectively).

For a given dimuon selection, we count the number of dimuon events where the leading muon parent
is a heavy ﬂavor meson (400 <pdgID< 600), designated by HF. The dimuon events where the leading
muon parent is not from heavy ﬂavor is designated as LF (for light ﬂavor).

In these samples, J0 to J3 have nearly no statistics, but high cross sections as compared to J4 to J8.
If all the samples are combined according to respective cross sections, then the J0-J3 samples with large
statistical uncertainties dominate the estimates and make drawing any conclusion impossible. To address
this we present numbers in two formats. First, we present the individually obtained numbers in each
sample, and the simple sum of numbers in each sample. Secondly, we present the cross-section weighted
sum of the J5 to J8 samples.

We start with the following nominal selection
• Two muons of the same charge with pT > 25, 15 GeV respectively.
• The leading muon is non isolated; we require ptcone20/pT > 0.2.
• The leading muon has high impact parameter significance; we require |d0/derr

0 | > 3.

and pID

This gives the fraction of HF to LF as (81 ± 1)% from the simple sum, and (96 ± 1)% from the weighted
sum of samples J5-J8. The raw numbers from the different samples are presented in Table 11.

Now in addition to the nominal selection, we require both muons to satisfy 1 − pMS

T < 0.2,
where pMS
T are the pT of the muon measured in the muon spectrometer (MS) and inner detector
T
(ID) respectively. This distribution is shown in Fig. 24 for all subleading muons in the A W+jets
samples. The distribution is shown separately for muons whose parent is either a light ﬂavor or a heavy
ﬂavor meson. After this selection has been imposed, the fraction of HF to LF is (96 ± 1)% from the
simple sum, and (98 ± 1)% from the weighted sum of samples J5-J8. The numbers for this heavy ﬂavor
enhanced selection are shown in Table 10.

T /pID

We conclude that after our selections, the fraction of HF in region C is very nearly one.
