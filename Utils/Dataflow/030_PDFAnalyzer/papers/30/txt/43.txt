Figure 36: Figure shows the d0/derr
(left) and relative isolation (right) distributions for the leading muon
0
for all dimuon events in the b¯b MC for events with 3 <NTracks< 7 and NTracks> 6. The distributions are
normalized to area. The KS probability of agreement of shapes is 0.66 for d0 significance and 6.6× 10−4
for the isolation.

Figure 37: The leading muon pT distribution in log scale in the background region (NTracks < 10). The
background histograms are stacked. The bottom part of the figure shows the ratio of data to prediction.
The error on the points is statistical, while the red band shows the systematic uncertainty.
