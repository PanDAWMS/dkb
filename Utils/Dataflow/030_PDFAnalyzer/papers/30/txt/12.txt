Figure 6: Figure shows the NTracks distribution for b¯b (left) and t¯t (right) simulation for like-sign dimuon
events. See section 5.1.2 for details.

of events for NTracks ≥ 15 from the fit is 203, and the true number of events is 174. For NTracks ≥ 20
we predict 17 events and the true number of events is 16.4. If we fit the distribution for 5 <NTracks< 10,
we predict 28 events for NTracks ≥ 20. The prediction and truth agree well within the 100% uncertainty
that we assign. We consider this a successful closure test.

5.2 Data based estimate of the fake background
In this section, we describe a data driven measurement of the fake muon background as it applies to
this analysis. The procedure consists of two steps: first we measure the per-track fake rate on a control
sample of events in data. We then apply this rate to data events with one muon + one or more tracks
where the muon passes the requirements of the leading muon for the analysis. This gives us a prediction
for dimuon events. While this method includes the contributions from Z+jets, and QCD dijet processes,
in practice the background is dominated by the W+jets process.

For the control sample we use W+track events. We select events with 25 < Emiss

( GeV) < 80 and
one isolated muon with pT > 25 GeV. We form the transverse mass (mT) of the muon with Emiss
and
require that 50 < mT( GeV) < 120. We also require NTracks < 10 to remove signal contribution. In
these selected W events, we require an additional track with pT > 15 GeV, which passes the tracking
requirements as listed in section 4. The track is required to have the same charge as the muon. This
forms the denominator. Each eligible track in the event is used for the denominator.

For the numerator, we require that an additional muon with pT > 15 GeV exists in the event passing
all muon requirements and this additional muon is of the same charge as the muon. The muon is also
matched to a denominator track. The numerator and denominator give us the rate of obtaining a second
muon of the same charge given a track. We measure this rate as a function of the track pT. In events with
more than one additional muon satisfying the requirements, all possible muons enter the numerator.

To avoid double counting we subtract the contributions of b¯b, t¯t, Wt and dibosons (WZ + ZZ) to the
fake rate by using the MC-driven methods that were discussed earlier in this section. The subtraction is
done from the fake rate in bins of track pT or η. In Fig. 7 we show the numerator as measured in the data
before the subtraction, and the estimates of the contributions which will be subtracted.
Figure 8 shows the measured fake rate as a function of track pT and |η| 3. The fake rate is constant
for pT > 20 GeV. We measure the fake rate in two bins, one for pT < 20 GeV and one for pT > 20 GeV.
The fake rate (and error) for pT > 20 GeV is obtained by fitting the fake rate with a straight line. For
