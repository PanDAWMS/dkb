Figure 32: Figure shows the isolation efficiency for leading muon in different signal MC samples as a
function of muon pT. The efficiency is measured only for those muons which originate promptly from
the black hole, or for muons arising from the decay of W and Z bosons from the black hole.

isolation cut is stable for all < µ >.

We also check to see if our track selection is sensitive to pileup. Figure 34 shows the two dimensional
distribution of NTracks versus < µ > for events with at least two muons with pT > 15 GeV each. We
check to see if the NTracks are correlated with the number of interactions; the correlation factors5 show
no such correlation. This is expected since the track pT is required to be greater than 10 GeV and the
tracks are required to point back to the same vertex as the muons in the event.

H Miscellaneous Figures
Figure 35 shows the distribution of events in the b¯b and t¯t simulation samples in the different regions as
described by Fig. 1. Figures 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, and 42 show the ratio of data to predicted background in
the bottom part of the figure; these figures are counterparts to figs. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 respectively.
Figures 43,43, and 43 show the limit plots for 2, 4 and 6 extra dimensions respectively with the actual

sample points used for limit calculation overlaid as black points.
