8 Interpretation of Results

No excess over the predicted standard model background is observed in the signal region. The p-value
for the observed result is 0.4 which corresponds to a 0.3 σ excess4. Using the observed number of data
events and the background expectations, upper limits are set on the cross section (σ) × the branching
ratio to dimuons (BR) × the acceptance (A) of non standard model contribution in the signal region. The
recommended CLs method [34, 35] is used to derive these upper limits. All statistical and systematic
uncertainties on the background are taken into account. The observed 95% confidence level limit on
σ × BR × A is 0.018 pb. The observed limit is very close to the expected limit of 0.016 pb. The 1σ and
2σ uncertainty band on the expected limit is 0.012-0.022 and 0.008-0.029 pb respectively.

Limits on the reduced Planck mass (MD) and the minimum mass of the black hole (MTH) are set
for several models. No theoretical uncertainty on signal prediction is assessed, that is, the exclusion
limits are set for the exact benchmark models as implemented in the B generator. The observed
results are used to obtain exclusion contours in the plane of MD and MTH. The MD-MTH plane has to
be populated by a large number of points to obtain the exclusion contours. For all points in this plane,
the signal acceptance is measured using generator level truth information. This truth-level acceptance is
compared to the acceptance from full detector simulation for a smaller set of model points (Appendix B
: Table 9). To account for the difference in acceptances, the truth level acceptance is scaled by a constant
factor of 0.7 ± 0.1 which is measured using the set of fully simulated points. The ratio of reconstructed
acceptance to truth accetpance is shown in Fig. 15.

The signal samples are generated with the CTEQ66 PDF. The uncertainty on the signal acceptance
from the choice of PDF is estimated by using the 44 error sets of the CTEQ66 PDF. For one signal sample
corresponding to a non-rotating black hole in six extra dimensions with MTH = 4000 GeV and MD =
500 GeV, statistically independent samples are generated for each error set. Two sets of such samples
are generated, one with 5000 events per sample, and one with 10000 events per sample. Figure 16
(left) shows the acceptance for each sample as a function of error set. The nominal value is at x=0.
Acceptances from both sets are shown; in red for 5000 events per sample, in black for 10000 events per
sample. The histogram of acceptances from the error sets is shown in Fig. 16 (right). The RMS of the
