Abstract

√

We present preliminary results for a search for new physics in a like sign dimuon final
s = 7 TeV. The data were collected with the ATLAS
state in proton-proton collisions at
detector in 2011 at the LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of (1.31 ± 0.04)
fb−1. With a high track multiplicity requirement, we predict 56± 7 events from the Standard
Model and we observe 60 events in the data. We interpret this result in the context of low-
scale gravity models and set a limit on the cross section times acceptance for the production
of mini blackholes.
