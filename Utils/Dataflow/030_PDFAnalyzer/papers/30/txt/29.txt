(a) Leading (left) and second (right) muon pT (linear scale)

(b) Leading (left) and second (right) muon pT (log scale)

Figure 20: Figure shows the pT distribution for leading (left) and second (right) muons for rotating black
hole signal in models with 6 extra dimensions. The distributions are shown for three choices of MTH;
3000, 4000, and 5000 GeV with MD fixed at 1500GeV.
Appendices
A Signal Properties

Figure 20 shows the leading and second muon pT distributions for three choices of MTH with the other
parameters held constant. Figure 21 shows the leading muon isolation distribution for the same choice
of models, while Fig. 22 shows the NTracks distribution. None of the distributions except NTracks show
strong correlation with MTH.

Figure 23 shows the signal acceptance as function of MTH (left) and MD (right) with other parameters

held constant.

B Details of Monte Carlo samples

Table 8 shows further details of the Monte Carlo samples used in this analysis. Table 9 shows the details
of the fully reconstructed signal samples used in Fig. 15.
