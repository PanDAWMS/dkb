5.3 Validation of Background Estimate
We validate the various background estimation techniques in data by predicting the number of events
with NTracks < 10. The complete selection is as described in section 4.

Table 3 shows the expected and observed events in this control region. For the b¯b background,
only the uncertainty on the ratio R = AMC/CMC as shown in section 5.1 is included. The systematic
uncertainties on the diboson and single-top backgrounds are not evaluated as they are expected to be
negligible compared to the dominant backgrounds. Figure 9 and Fig. 10 show the pT distributions for
the leading and second muons respectively. Figure 11 shows the dimuon invariant mass distribution. The
corresponding figures with the ratio of data to background are shown in Figures 37, 38, and 39.

5.3.1 Validation of t¯t MC
The t¯t MC prediction is validated in a control region with the following selection.

• Events are required to have two opposite-sign muons with pT > 25, 15 GeV respectively. The

muons are required to be isolated by requiring ptcone20/pT < 0.2 for both.

• A third muon (of either charge) with pT > 15 GeV is required. No isolation is imposed on the third

muon.

• Events are required to have high missing energy; Emiss
• Events are required to have NTracks < 10 to remove potential signal contamination.

T > 60 GeV.

With this selection, t¯t production is dominant. The predicted number of events, and the data observation
is shown in Table 4. The µµ+fake contribution is estimated in the same way as the µ + f ake background
estimate discussed in section 5.2, and is dominated by the Z+jets process. The other predictions (viz. t¯t,
WZ, ZZ) are made using the nominal simulation samples. The observed number of events in data agrees
with the prediction at the 20% level, and the prediction of the t¯t MC sample is thus validated.

6 Systematic Uncertainties
6.1 Data based estimation of background
The uncertainty on the muon fake rate due to measurement statistics is 8%. The rate is applied to each
track in muon+track events. Let the rate be denoted by fi for the ith track. When events have more than
