G Miscellaneous Studies

In this section, we present other auxiliary studies.

We check the efficiency of our isolation selection, ptcone20/pT < 0.2 in a sample of Z events. We
use the standard tag-and-probe method. Events with two muons of opposite sign and with invariant mass
satisfying 81 < Mµµ( GeV) < 101 are selected. The muon selection is the same as described for the
analysis. The tag muon is required to be isolated, and the efficiency for the probe muon to be isolated is
measured in data and MC. The data sample is the same as the one used for this analysis. The MC sample
is a P Z → µµ sample with MC10b pileup conditions. Figure 31 shows the measured isolation
efficiency in data and MC and the scale factor (Data/MC). The measured scale factor is 0.999. We also
the measure the scale factor for the d0 significance requirement (d0/derr
0 < 3) for these Z events. The
scale factor for isolated probes is 0.998. Both the isolation and d0 significance scale factors are close to
1 and we do not apply any corrections to the MC samples in this analysis.

We also find that the isolation efficiency in signal is stable at high pT. In Figure 32, we show the
isolation efficiency for the leading muon for two different black hole samples. The efficiency is only
measured for truly isolated muons by requiring that the muons originate promptly from the black hole,
or arise from the decay of W or Z bosons from the black hole.

To check the effect of pileup, we measure the isolation efficiency for muons in the Z, t¯t and b¯b
MC samples as a function of < µ >, the average number of interactions per event. Here the efficiency
is measured for all muons matched to a truth-level muon. Figure 33 shows that the efficiency for our
