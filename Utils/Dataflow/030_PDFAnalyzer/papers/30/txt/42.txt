Figure 34: Figure shows the distribution of NTracks versus < µ > for events with at least two muons
with pT > 15 GeV each in different simulation samples. NTracks is found to be uncorrelated with < µ >
as indicated by the correlation factors shown in the figure.

Figure 35: Figure shows the regions as described in Fig. 1 populated by events for the b¯b MC (left) and
for the t¯t MC (right).
