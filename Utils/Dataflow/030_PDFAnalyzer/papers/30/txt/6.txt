• The muons are required to satisfy ∆Rη−φ > 0.2 to explicitly ensure that the isolated muon is away

from the second muon.

• The leading and second muons are required to have the same charge.
• The tracks used in the counting of track multiplicity (NTracks) are required to have pT > 10 GeV.
Tracks are also required to have |η| < 2.4, and pass all the same inner detector hit requirements
as the muons. The tracks are also required to come from the primary vertex by requiring that
|z0 sin(θ)| < 1.5 mm. The track count includes the two muons.

The track multiplicity, NTracks, is used to define two regions. A background region with NTracks <
10 and the signal region with NTracks ≥ 10. The background region has identical requirements except
for the inverted NTracks selection. Appendix A shows the pT and NTrack distributions for sample signal
models.

4.1 Muon Trigger and Identification
No trigger requirement is imposed on MC events. Instead the MC events are weighted according to their
probability of being triggered by any muon in the event. The weight is computed using the efficiency
curves from Ref. [30]. The trigger efficiency has been measured in data for good oﬄine Staco muons
which match to the trigger at L1 within ∆Rη−φ of 0.5. We make this same requirement in our data events
for consistency. The trigger efficiency for EF mu20 is at a plateau for pT > 20 GeV and the plateau
efficiency is 75% for muons in the barrel and 88% for muons in the endcap. In the analysis we use pT
dependent trigger efficiencies for endcap and barrel, which are measured for three different run ranges,
178044≤ Run ≤182519 (75% plateau for barrel), 182519< Run ≤183347 (72% plateau for barrel) and
Run >183347 (77% plateau for barrel). The efficiency in the endcap is the same (88% plateau) for all
run ranges.

The MC predicts the muon identification and reconstruction efficiencies very well. As per the rec-
ommendations of the Muon Combined Performance Group [29], we apply weights to the MC events
which are dependent on muon η and φ to account for the differences in muon identification efficiency
in data and MC. We also smear the muon pT according to the recommendations. The MC samples are
reweighted to match their < µ > distribution to data, where < µ > is the mean number of interactions in
an event.

5 Background Estimation

We group possible sources of background into the following two categories:

• Processes with associated production of dimuon events of the same sign. These include b¯b, t¯t,
diboson (WZ,ZZ) production as well as single top production in the Wt channel (which is identical
to t¯t). The backgrounds from t¯t, single-top and dibosons are estimated completely from simulation
using samples listed in Table 1. In the signal region, the diboson and single-top backgrounds are
found to be negligible. The b¯b background is estimated using data and simulation as described in
section 5.1. The dominant background in this category is t¯t.

• Processes with same-sign dimuons, where the muons come from uncorrelated decay chains. We
expect the dominant process to be W+jets where one muon comes from W decay and the other
muon comes from a pion/kaon decay in ﬂight or the semi-leptonic decay of b, c hadrons. We
estimate this contribution completely from data by measuring the probability of a track to give
a muon, and applying this to all muon+track events in the signal region. The method is further
