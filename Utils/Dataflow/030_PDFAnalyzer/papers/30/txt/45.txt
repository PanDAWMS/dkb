Figure 40: The NTracks distribution for all like-sign dimuon events. In this figure the shape of the b¯b
background is taken from the fit shown in Fig. 6. The background histograms are stacked, the signal
histogram is overlaid. The bottom part of the figure shows the ratio of data to prediction. The error on
the points is statistical, while the red band shows the systematic uncertainty.

Figure 41: The leading (left) and second (right) muon pT distributions in the signal region. The back-
ground histograms are stacked, the signal histogram is overlaid. The bottom part of the figure shows the
ratio of data to prediction. The error on the points is statistical, while the red band shows the systematic
uncertainty.
