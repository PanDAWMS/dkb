1 Introduction
The hierarchy problem, in which the Planck scale (MPl = 1.2 × 1019 GeV) is vastly large compared to
the electroweak scale of 100 GeV, is one of the major motivations for new physics. A theory introducing
extra dimensions is one possible solution. In some theories of extra dimensions, the gravitational field
propagates into n + 4 dimensions, where n is the number of extra dimensions over the 4 spacetime
dimensions. The Standard Model particles are localized in the 4 space-time dimensions. Since the
gravitational field propagates into the extra dimensions, it is reduced from the fundamental gravitational
force to the weak gravitational field we observe. Thus, the fundamental Planck scale in n + 4 dimensions,
MD, would be much smaller than MPl and comparable with the electroweak scale.

One of the theories of the extra dimensions is the ADD model, which is the model of large ﬂat
extra dimensions, proposed by Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali [1, 2, 3]. Extra dimensions are
compactified in cylinder shape of which radius equal R, and MD is related to MPl as [4, 5]

Experimental limits on MD by the collider experiments are reported by the LEP and the Tevatron exper-
iments; MD > 1.60, 1.20, 1.04, 0.98, 0.94 , 0.80 TeV for each n = 2,··· , 7, respectively [6, 7, 8]. The
CMS experiment at the LHC excludes the production of black holes with MTH of 4, 4.4, and 4.5 TeV for
MD of 1.5 TeV for n = 2, 4, and 6 respectively [9], where MTH is the minimum mass of the produced
black holes.

If extra dimensions exist and MD is of order TeV, mini black holes with TeV scale mass can exist and
they can be produced by the Large Hadron Collider. In this analysis, mini black holes were searched for
in a same charge dimuon final state. The analysis presented in this note is an extension of the analysis
carried out in 2010 data and documented in Ref. [10, 11]. The reader is urged to read those notes to gain
an understanding of the motivation for this analysis and for some of the selections used here.

A brief review of the theoretical considerations of black hole production and decay can be found

in [12].

1.1 Analysis Strategy
Black holes decay to all particles in the Standard Model. If black holes are produced with masses well
above the new physics scale, they are anticipated to decay initially by Hawking evaporation. In this
case, the relative production probabilities for different particle types from the black holes depend on
the coupling of the particle to gravity, and the dynamics of the process given by the relative thermal
emissivities. Since gravity couples only to the energy-momentum content of matter, it is anticipated that
gravity couples to all particle degrees of freedom in the theory equally. The relative emissivity of the
process is governed by the dynamics and depends on the mass, angular momentum, and gauges charges
of the non-perturbative gravitation state and the mass, spin, and gauge charges of the particle being
emitted.

The classic signature for a black hole decay is multiple high pT objects. An analysis based on a
multijet signature is presented in Ref. [13]. We use a different approach in this analysis: the signal region
is defined in terms of track multiplicity, and we use leptons to reduce Standard Model backgrounds.
Specifically, we require that there are two muons, and that the muons are of the same charge. This
has the benefit of having very small Standard Model background, while having an appreciable signal
acceptance. We perform a cut-and-count analysis after explicitly defining the signal selection in terms of
track multiplicity.
