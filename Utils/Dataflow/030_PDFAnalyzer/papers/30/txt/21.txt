Figure 12: The NTracks distribution for all like-sign dimuon events. In this figure the shape of the b¯b
background is taken from the fit shown in Fig. 6. We select the region with NTracks ≥ 10 as the signal
region. The background histograms are stacked, the signal histogram is overlaid.

Table 6: Number of expected and observed events in the signal region, like-sign dimuon events with
NTracks ≥ 10. The signal expectation for the point with MT H = 4000 GeV is also shown. The other
backgrounds are from diboson and single-top Wt processes.
