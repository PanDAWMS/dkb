Table 5: Systematic uncertainties in percent on the background estimates in the signal region from vari-
ous sources. µ reco/trig stands for the uncertainty due to trigger efficiency weight and muon reconstruc-
tion efficiency scale factors applied to the Monte Carlo events.

• We test the effect of initial and final state radiation by checking the t¯t prediction using a sample
where the ISR and FSR have been enhanced over nominal versus a sample where both ISR and
FSR have been decreased versus nominal. These samples have been generated with A and
hadronized with . This yields an uncertainty of 7%.

• The systematic uncertainty due to trigger efficiency and muon identification scalefactors is 2.6%.
The total systematic uncertainty on t¯t from all sources is 14.5%.

6.3 Estimation of b¯b background
In the background region with NTracks < 10, the uncertainty on b¯b background is from the measurement
of R = AMC/CMC as described in section 5.1. In the signal region, in addition a 100% uncertainty is taken
on the b¯b estimate which arises from the extrapolation in the NTracks variable as described in Step 2 in
section 5.1.

Table 6 shows the expected and observed number of events for like-sign dimuon events with NTracks
360 ≥ 10. The expected background contributions from diboson and single-top Wt are listed as other back-
grounds. In Table 7, the prediction and observation is shown broken into categories based on muon
charge.

Figure 12 shows the NTracks distribution for signal and background control regions. Figure 13 shows
the pT distributions of the leading and second muon in the signal region. Figure 14 shows the invariant
mass distribution of the dimuons in the signal region.
