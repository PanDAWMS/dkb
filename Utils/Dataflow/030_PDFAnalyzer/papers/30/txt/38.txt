b-hadron decays (a more precise value for w could be obtained from Monte-Carlo, but this didn’t
seem necessary).

When only muons from B and D decays are considered, we can obtain a like-sign dimuon pair
from a generic bb event if one of the b-hadrons undergoes mixing or if a wrong sign D decays into
a muon. With the above assumptions, the total fraction of like-sign dimuon pairs expected from the
different combinations of semi-leptonic decay of b hadron or D meson, mixing, and production of right
and wrong sign D mesons is:

fpair = 2 · f 2
S L {

+ O( f 3
S L)

(1 − χ)χ +

(1 − χ)(1 − fS L)(cid:2)(1 − χ)w + χ(1 − w)(cid:3) +
χ(1 − fS L)(cid:2)(1 − χ)(1 − w) + χw(cid:3) +
(1 − fS L)2(cid:2)(1 − χ)(1 − w) + χw(cid:3) ·
(cid:2)(1 − χ)w + χ(1 − w)(cid:3) }

Term 1 concerns the case where both muons come from semi-muonic b-hadron decays, terms 2 and 3 are
from events where one muon comes from a b-hadron and the other comes from a D decay, while terms
4 and 5 account for muons coming from D decays only. Contributions with more than two semileptonic
decays are of O( f 3

S L) and are neglected in this simple estimate.

With the numerical values for χ and w indicated above we obtain

If mixing is turned off (χ = 0), we get

fpair = 0.87 · 2 f 2

S L

fpair = 0.85 · 2 f 2

S L

Thus with the above assumptions the fractions of like-sign dimuon pairs obtained with and without
B mixing are very similar. This is not surprising, given that the fraction w of wrong-sign D mesons
is relatively large (i.e. when mixing is turned off, a B meson that would have otherwise decayed after
mixing is likely to decay into a wrong-sign D meson and to produce a muon of the required charge, thus
compensating for turning off mixing).
