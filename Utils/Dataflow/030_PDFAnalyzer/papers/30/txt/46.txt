Figure 42: Figure shows the invariant mass distribution of the dimuons in the signal region. The back-
ground histograms are stacked, the signal histogram is overlaid. The bottom part of the figure shows the
ratio of data to prediction. The error on the points is statistical, while the red band shows the systematic
uncertainty.

Figure 43: 95% confidence level exclusion contours for non-rotating (left) and rotating (right) black
holes with two extra dimensions taking into account all statistical and systematic uncertainties. The
dashed blue line shows the expected exclusion contour with the 1 and 2 σ uncertainty in green and
yellow respectively. The solid black line shows the observed exclusion contour. The region below the
contour has been excluded by this analysis. The figures show lines of constant slope equal to 3,4, and
5. Only slopes much larger than 1 correspond to physical models. The actual sample points used for the
limit calculation are shown as black dots.
