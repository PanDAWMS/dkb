F Fraction of like-sign dimuon events in bb Monte-Carlo events with and

without mixing

The bb Monte-Carlo sample used in this analysis was produced with B meson mixing turned off. In
order to estimate the potential effect of this we estimate the fraction of like-sign dimuon pairs expected
in a generic sample of bb events. The following estimate does not take differences in the pT spectrum of
muons B and D decays into account.

We make the following assumptions:
• We consider only muons from B and D decays.
• We assume a single average semi-leptonic branching fraction fS L = 0.10 for the decay of all b
hadrons and D mesons into a muon (the inclusive branching fractions into muons are quite different
for D± and D0, but their average is sufficiently close to 0.10 for the purpose of this estimate).

• We use an average B − B mixing parameter χ = 0.13 [5].
• We assume the production of at least one D meson in each B decay.
• We define a right sign muon as a µ+ (µ−) produced directly or through a secondary decay from a
b (b) hadron. Muons of the opposite charge will be referred to as wrong sign muons. Similarly,
we refer to D0, D+, and D+
s ) produced in a b (b) hadron decay as right sign
D since their semi-muonic decay would produce a right sign muon. Based on the inclusive data
available from [5]. we assume that a wrong sign D meson is produced in a fraction w = 0.8 of

s (D0, D−, and D−
