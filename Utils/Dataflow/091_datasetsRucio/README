Stage 091_datasetsRucio
=======================

1. Description
--------------
Obtain datasets' metadata from Rucio and process the supplied tasks' metadata
in one of the two ways:

1) input mode - update the tasks' metadata with the input datasets' metadata
   from Rucio.
2) output mode - extract the information about output datasets and update it
   with corresponding metadata from Rucio.

2. Requirements
---------------
* pyRucio
* proper configuration file (see below)
* proper memberships and grid certificate (see below)

Rucio requires authentication, which is performed by supplying a number of
things, such as certificate or user name. In case of this stage, the
authentication is performed as following:

1) The stage sets up the environment variable VIRTUAL_ENV, its value will be
   "~/.rucio" (if it exists), or "./.rucio" otherwise.
2) Rucio client looks for configuration file "rucio.cfg" in
   "VIRTUAL_ENV/etc/" (and some other places).
3) Rucio client retrieves the necessary information from the config and
   authenticates the user.

Therefore, a correct configuration file should be put into designated place.
Repository contains an example with correct values for most of the parameters:

  Utils/Dataflow/091_datasetsRucio/.rucio/etc/rucio.cfg.example

The following parameters should be updated:

* account - username in CERN systems.
* client_cert - full path to the user's grid certificate.
* client_key - full path to the key corresponding to the user's grid
  certificate.

Being able to do so requires:

1) Registering in CERN systems (discuss this with your supervisor).
2) Obtaining a grid certificate (https://ca.cern.ch/ca/).
3) Registering in ATLAS Virtual Organization (VO ATLAS, see link below).
