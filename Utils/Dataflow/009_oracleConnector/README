* Stage 009 *
=============

1. Description
--------------
Takes data from Oracle with SQL query, stored in file, and output
them as NDJSON.

Currently works with specific set of queries only:
 * prodsys2ES + datasets
 * prodsys2ES

The goal is to make it work with any number and combination of queries.

2. HowTo
--------
To run `prodsys2ES` and `datasets` queries and join the results, use
  SQUASH mode:

  ./oracle2JSON.py --config $CONFIG --mode SQUASH

To run `prodsys2ES` query only, use PLAIN mode:

  ./oracle2JSON.py --config $CONFIG --mode PLAIN

A template for the configuration file can be obtained in Dataflow's
corresponding directory:

  Utils/Dataflow/config/009.cfg.example
