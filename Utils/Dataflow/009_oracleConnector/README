=============
* Stage 009 *
=============

1. Description
--------------
Takes data from Oracle with SQL query, stored in file, and output
them as NDJSON.

Currently works with specific set of queries only:
 * prodsys2ES + datasets
 * prodsys2ES
 * consistency : simplified query that only obtains taskid and task_timestamp
   for each task

The goal is to make it work with any number and combination of queries.

2. HowTo
--------
To run stage, use:

  ./oracle2JSON.py --config CONFIG

A template for the configuration file can be obtained in Dataflow's
corresponding directory:

  Utils/Dataflow/config/009.cfg.example

3. Samples
----------
The 'output' directory contains two samples of production data:

  sample2016.ndjson - collected with timestamps [09-05-2016 12:12:00, 09-05-2016 13:32:30]
  sample2018.ndjson - collected with timestamps [15-06-2018 12:00:00, 15-06-2018 13:00:00]
