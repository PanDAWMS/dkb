The dataset used for this analysis represents an integrated luminosity of 3.1 pb\u22121. Dijet chi distributions and centrality ratios have been measured over a range of dijet masses from 250 to 2800 GeV, and found to be in good agreement with perturbative QCD. A Frequentist analysis of the chi distributions excludes quark contact interactions with a scale factor Lambda below 3.43 TeV, at 95% confidence level. The highest-mass dijet satisfying all criteria in the current analysis is 2.8 TeV.",
