The measurement covers the pseudorapidity ranges $|\\eta^\\gamma|<1.37$ and $1.52\\leq|\\eta^\\gamma|<2.37$, in the transverse energy range $45\\leq E_{T}^{\\gamma}<400$ GeV. The results are based on an integrated luminosity of 35 pb$^{-1}$, collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Photon candidates are identified by exploiting the fine granularity of the electromagnetic calorimeter, which provides event-by-event rejection of the dominant background from photons produced by $\\pi^{0}$ decays, and of the inner detector, which allows the reconstruction of photons that convert to electron-positron pairs. Residual background in the selected sample is estimated using data-driven techniques based on the observed distribution of the isolation energy in a narrow cone around the photon candidate. The results are compared with next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations.",
