In the trigger enhanced method, the relative reconstruction efficiency is estimated from the matching of a combined track with a reference represented by a Inner Detector (ID) track matching a muon trigger Region of Interest. In the ``B-jets'' enhanced method a 99 % pure sample of mu from B decays has been selected from ID tracks using b-tagging and the muon identification capabilities of the calorimeter. The results are compared with Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, deriving scale factors as the relative differences between data and Monte Carlo. The data to MC ratio of the muon reconstruction efficiency is found to be epsilon_DATA/epsilon_MC = 0.986 +/- 0.003 +/- 0.010.",

The data have been recorded using different configurations of the level-1 muon trigger for an integrated luminosity of 1.4 pb$^-1$. The result is compared with the Next-To-Leading Order with Next to Leading Log high $p_{T}$ resummation prediction for the heavy flavour production and with MC@NLO prediction for W-Z bosons production. The measurement is sensitive for the first time to the Next to Leading Log contribution to the heavy flavour production in hadronic interactions.",
