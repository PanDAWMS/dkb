The measurement is performed with 36~\\ipb\\ of data observed with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. $Z$-bosons are identified using electron and muon decay modes. Jets are reconstructed with the anti-kT algorithm. Inclusive cross-sections, $\\sigma(Z+\\geq{N\\:}{\\rm jets})$, are measured for events with a $Z$-boson and N or more jets (N=0-4). Differential cross-sections d$\\sigma$($Z$~+~jets)/d$p_T$ are measured with respect to the transverse momenta $p_T$, and to the rapidities of the first, 2nd and 3rd leading jets. In addition, we normalize the total cross section per bin in multiplicity or in $p_T$ to the inclusive $Z$ cross section and calculate ratios $\\sigma(Z+\\geq{N+1\\:}{\\rm jets})/\\sigma(Z+\\geq{N}\\:{\\rm jets})$ between the inclusive cross-sections, to cancel out systematic uncertainties. The cross-sections and their ratios are corrected for all detector effects and are given for the fiducial, restricted, region of the detector acceptance. We compare the measured cross-sections to next-to-leading order (NLO) pQCD calculations from MCFM and leading-order simulations from ALPGEN, PYTHIA, and SHERPA. The observed cross-sections are found in agreement with the NLO predictions.",
