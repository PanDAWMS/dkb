In the data set considered here, the average number of collisions per bunch crossing ranged from 0.6 to 2 and the instantaneous luminosity ranged from 0.3 to 1 x 1e31 cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. Hence, the impact of the pile-up on the MET and SumET triggers is not negligible.",

Approximately 45 pb^{-1} of proton-proton collision data at a centre of mass energy of sqrt(s)= 7 TeV were collected under stable beam conditions. In the initial commissioning phase the event selection was based only on the first level trigger. The high-level trigger was run but without rejecting any events. With increasing luminosities the high-level trigger was progressively put in to rejection mode. Since August, when a liminosity of ~10^{31} cm^{-2} {s}^{-1} was reached, all triggers have relied on the HLT selection. In this note results from the commissioning phase as well as first results of the physics performance will be shown. Comparisons of selection variables, based on calorimeter and tracking information calculated by the different trigger levels, with the offline reconstruction will be shown. This has been an important step in the commissioning of these triggers to ensure their correct functioning. Electrons from physics signals such as J/Psi->ee, W->enu, Z->ee have been used to extract the trigger efficiencies with respect to the offline benchmark selections. HLT efficiencies are typically of the order of 99%, and are higher for offline electrons and photons with transverse energies above the turn-on region.",
