These exclude at the 95% CL the q* mass interval 0.60 < mq* < 2.05 TeV and the axigluon mass interval 0.60 < m < 1.87 TeV, extending the reach of previous searches. Upper limits were also set on the number of observed resonance events in a model-independent way, as a function of resonance mass and width.

Using a dataset with an integrated luminosity of 36 pb\u22121, dijet mass and angular distributions have been measured up to dijet masses of \" 3.5 TeV and found to be in good agreement with Standard Model predictions. This analysis sets limits at 95% C.L. on various models for new physics: an excited quark is excluded with mass between 0.60 and 2.64 TeV, an axigluon hypothesis is excluded for axigluon masses between 0.60 and 2.10 TeV and Randall-Meade quantum black holes are excluded in models with six extra space-time dimensions for quantum gravity scales between 0.75 and 3.67 TeV. Production cross section limits as a function of dijet mass are set using a simplified Gaussian signal model to facilitate comparisons with other hypotheses. Analysis of the dijet angular distribution using a novel technique simultaneously employing the dijet mass excludes quark contact interactions with a compositeness scale Lambda below 9.51 TeV.",
