The observables studied are the transverse thrust, thrust minor and transverse sphericity, all defined over final state momenta perpendicular to the beam direction. These variables are calculated using tracks in inclusive minimum-bias events. In addition to differential distributions, the evolution of event shape variables as a function of the leading track $p_T$ is presented. The data is compared with different Monte-Carlo models, and significant difference from the predictions are observed.",

Events with at least six charged particles are selected.
