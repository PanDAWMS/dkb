* Stage 19 *
============

Description
-----------
Prepare data, taken by Oracle Connector, before uploading to ElasticSearch:
 * turn JSON keys to lower case
 * generate JSON with index information

Use ./run.sh to run stage with common configuration from
  /Utils/Elasticsearch/config/es

Input
-----
...comes from Oracle Connector: JSON documents, one document -- one line.

Output
------
JSON documents, one document per line:
{{{
 <index info>
 <data>
 <index info>
 <data>
 ...
}}}

TODO
----
Currently, it operates as if one line was one message (piece of information).
For input it is OK, but for output it would be better to take <index info> and
  <data> JSON documents together, as one message. I don`t know where it will
  be critical for now, but something tells me that it will.
This task requires accurate EOMessage and EOProcess markers handling (see the
  `kafka-dataflow-markers` branch).
