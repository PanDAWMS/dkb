* Stage 071 *
=============

1. Description
--------------
Checks that the given data is present in ElasticSearch.

Input must contain at least 2 fields:
{{{
{"_type": ..., "_id": ..., ...}
...
}}}

Fields in input are divided into two groups - service fields (ones starting
with "_") and data fields (all the other ones).
Data fields are compared with the document's corresponding ones, results of
the comparison are written to stderr.
Certain service fields are used by the stage to perform the comparison:
- "_type" and "_id" are required to retrieve the document from ES.
- "_parent" is required when retrieving child documents, such as output
datasets.
Other service fields are ignored.

2. Running the stage
--------------------
The stage can be run as following:

  ./consistency.py --conf elasticsearch_config

For more information about running the stage and its arguments, use:
