=============
* Stage 10  *
=============

1. Description
--------------
Takes information about papers and supporting documents from GLANCE system.

papersFromGLANCE.py
-------------------
Can be run only from CERN server.

papersFromGLANCE.sh
--------------------------
Can be run from everywhere.
Needs to be run with Kerberos ticket valid for CERN.CH realm.

2. Output
---------
...is in JSON format.

papersFromGLANCE.py produces list_of_papers.json.

papersFromGLANCE.sh can output to file (-f|--file), named pipe (-p|--pipe) or
stdout (default).

3. Kafka Connect
----------------
As a step of Kafka data flow it is a Source stage.

One can use papersFromGLANCE.sh with Kafka Connect application in three ways:
- using ExternalSourceConnector: 
  {{{
  ../000_kafka/run.sh 010GlancePapers {start|stop|restart}
  }}}
  After the stage is run, papersFromGLANCE.sh will be run every POLL.INTERVAL.MS
  and its output data are written to the TOPIC
  (for parameters see ../000_kafka/config/010-glance-lop-source.properties);

- runPipeConnector with (-c|--command) parameter. Then data will be output to
  the PipeConnector source pipe, but only once.

- runPipeConnector without (-c|--command) parameter, and then run
  papersFromGLANCE.sh with (-p|--pipe) parameter pointing to the PipeConnector
  source pipe.

The last variant allows us to run papersFromGLANCE.sh by cron and be sure
that data will be delivered to Kafka topic immideately.

TODO:
* make papersFromGLANCE.sh take care of continuous data production
  (not needed when ExternalSourceConnector is used):
 - run the script's body every -T|--timeout SEC seconds;
 - make sure that kwenew -H MIN interval is less then -T|--timeout SEC.
